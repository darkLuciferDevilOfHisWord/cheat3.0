Explanation:
For S2: Take L = (0 + 1)* which is R.E. and L’ = Ld which is not R.E.
Enumerator for L outputs all strings in L’ but also outputs strings that may not be in L’, So it is not enumerator for L’.

  abc	abc
  
  Common string abc will be derived either using S1 or S2.

  6.	Let R be Regular set. Let S be set consisting of all strings in R which are identical with their own reverses. What can you say about S?
  (a) S is regular	(b) S is non-regular
  (c) S may or may not be regular	(d) None of the above
  
  Solution: Option (c)
   
  Explanation:
  R = 0*10*
  S = {0n10n | n ≥ 0} is CFL.
  
  
  7.	Suppose L is a context-free language over Ʃ = {a} i.e. only one alphabet. What can you say about L?
  (a) L is always regular	(b) L need not be regular
  (c) L is always DCFL	(d) L is always NCFL
  
  Solution: Option (a)
  
  Explanation:
  CFL over one alphabet will always be regular.
  
  
  8.	Minimum number of states in DFA over Ʃ = {0, 1} with each string contains odd number of 0’s or odd number of 1’s.
  (a) 3	(b) 4
  (c) 5	(d) 6
  
  Solution: Option (b)
  
  
  9.	Let L be a Context Free Language. Even(L) is the set of all strings w in L such that |w| is even. What can you say about even(L)?
  (a) It will be regular	(b) It will be context-free
  (c) It is not decidable	(d) None of the above
  
  Solution: Option (b)
  
  Explanation:
  Even(L) is the intersection of L with the DFA that accepts even length strings
  i.e. Even (L) = CFL ⋂ Regular
  = CFL
  So, Even (L) is a closed operation.

  11.	Let L be a regular language. Consider L’ = {xy: x∈L and y ∉ L}
  L’ is
  
  (a) Always regular	(b) Need not be regular
  (c) Context-free	(d) Depends on L
  
  Solution: Option (a)
  
  Explanation:
  L’  is  concatenation  of  2  regular  languages  basically  L  and  L̅.  Regular  are  closed  under concatenation.
  
  
  12.	Consider two statements:

  (a) Both are True	(b) Both are False
  (c) S1 → True, S2 → False	(d) S1 → False, S2 → True
  Solution: Option (b)
